Hi Paul,
in the new version currently in private beta we stop processes after 1 day of inactivity for free users and 1 week of inactivity for premium users. On the current backend processes are usually stopped a few hours after the last access. I can add you to the peta if you are interested.
Best,
Fabian

Hello, is there a default timeout or uptime limit  for running apps? 
I thought I had left my app running last night and it was down this morning.
I started it again ok now but was just wondering how long it should run before shutting down.
thank you.

 Use of secondary harmonies[edit]
Introducing altered tones melodically often produces 
only a weak feeling of tonicization. Stronger tonicizations 
are frequently achieved by borrowing not only pitches 
from the tonicized key, but also chords 
(known as "secondary chords" or "secondary harmonies").
The most common such chord is the secondary dominant; 
this is simply a chord that is dominant to the tonicized key
and is usually one of the following: V, V7, viio (usually not in root position),
or viio7 (often in root position). 
In musical analysis (see diatonic functions), a secondary dominant is notated 
with a slash separating the tonicized scale degree and the type of secondary dominant
chord used. 

For example, if the original tonic is C Major and a tonicization of F Major 
(the subdominant and 4th scale degree of C Major) is desired, 
one could use the V7 chord of F Major (which is C7) as a
secondary dominant to approach F.

still unable to deploy app to openshift
requested c9 support to enable my account on beta.

set up github repo today 6/6/2014
iotg1
todo: push c9 app to github repo.
Step 3: Push your commit
So far, everything you've done has been in your local repository, meaning you still haven't done anything on GitHub yet. To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your repository and push your commits to it.
More about remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
# Creates a remote named "origin" pointing at your GitHub repository

git push origin master
# Sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub
Tip: Notice that the path to your remote URL--Hello-World.git--matches the one that you created on GitHub. This is case sensitive, and important to keep the same.
