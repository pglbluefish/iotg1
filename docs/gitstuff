git add .
git commit
git push origin master    //push to github
git push openshift master   //push to openshift

large size errer failed to push to github
solution:
As rlb.usa noted, Github has added a file size limit that prevents you from pushing files > 100MB. You tried to remove the file in a new commit and tried to push that. That fails, because you are not just pushing that last commit, but also three others. Those three commits contain versions of cron_log that are 141MB and 126MB in size. They cause your push to fail.

git checkout -- .    //gets rid of "unstaged files"

git filter-branch --force --index-filter  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch giant_file'   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

(did git filter... for each of the 3 files that were too big >50mb
eg. data/local.0,  data/test.0,  data/test.1)


better to add indiviudal files/directories than git add . or git commit -a.

Git: How to add new files and directories?
Posted on January 30, 2012
If you are working with Git and want to add a new file or directory, follow the following steps

Go to the directory where your file is located.

$ cd directory
$ git add filename
Now you must commit these changes (You can give necessary comments)

$ git commit -m "Adding a new file"
If you want to add a directory, Go to the directory where the directory you want to add is located.

$ cd directory
$ git add directoryname
Now you must commit these changes (You can give necessary comments)

$ git commit -m "Adding a new directory"
