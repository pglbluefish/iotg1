 Use of secondary harmonies[edit]
Introducing altered tones melodically often produces 
only a weak feeling of tonicization. Stronger tonicizations 
are frequently achieved by borrowing not only pitches 
from the tonicized key, but also chords 
(known as "secondary chords" or "secondary harmonies").
The most common such chord is the secondary dominant; 
this is simply a chord that is dominant to the tonicized key
and is usually one of the following: V, V7, viio (usually not in root position),
or viio7 (often in root position). 
In musical analysis (see diatonic functions), a secondary dominant is notated 
with a slash separating the tonicized scale degree and the type of secondary dominant
chord used. 

For example, if the original tonic is C Major and a tonicization of F Major 
(the subdominant and 4th scale degree of C Major) is desired, 
one could use the V7 chord of F Major (which is C7) as a
secondary dominant to approach F.
