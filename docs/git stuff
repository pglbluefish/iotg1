large size errer failed to push to github
solution:
As rlb.usa noted, Github has added a file size limit that prevents you from pushing files > 100MB. You tried to remove the file in a new commit and tried to push that. That fails, because you are not just pushing that last commit, but also three others. Those three commits contain versions of cron_log that are 141MB and 126MB in size. They cause your push to fail.

To fix that, you have two options:

Run git rebase -i origin/master, set every commit to edit and remove the file in each with git commit --amend.
Use the BFG Repo-Cleaner to clean all your history.
