Hi Paul,
in the new version currently in private beta we stop processes after 1 day of inactivity for free users and 1 week of inactivity for premium users. On the current backend processes are usually stopped a few hours after the last access. I can add you to the peta if you are interested.
Best,
Fabian

Hello, is there a default timeout or uptime limit  for running apps? 
I thought I had left my app running last night and it was down this morning.
I started it again ok now but was just wondering how long it should run before shutting down.
thank you.

installed rhc on cloud 9 in ubuntu directory
rhc setup   failed with errors
try again after pull push (see below)


well needed to do a pull before push??
that was interesting but all worked!!  think all is synched (github, c9, openshift) next see ifopenshift web site is working


will def need this reference for openshift

use this full path to run rhc commands  (rhc is a command not a directory)
/usr/local/bin/rhc
 rhc setup still not working seems to be looking in a depedency file in rubygems (dependency.rb) missing a pointer to rhc??
 using full path to rhc does not matter...
 

doing this first and then reinstalling rhc

$ sudo gem install rubygems-update 
$ sudo update_rubygems

$ gem install rhc
pglbluefish@otg1:/home/ubuntu/workspace (master) $ gem install rhc

finally to deploy c9 app
duplicate server_express40_bk2.js to server.js and put in main (nodecellar) folder.
duplicate clientfiles/template2/index.html and put in main (nodecellar) folder.
   edit index.html in main (nodecellar) folder to point to /clientiles/template2/css/style.css
   
   commit and 
   push c9(master) to github(origin) 
   push c9(master) to openshift(openshift) 
   
   restart openshift app
   pglbluefish@otg1:/home/ubuntu/workspace (master) $ rhc app-stop iotg1pglbluefish                                                 
RESULT:
iotg1pglbluefish stopped

new task:  ssh to openshift app and view log file
ssh to openshift app gear
exit
Connection to iotg1pglbluefish-iotg1pglbluefish.rhcloud.com closed.


***need to edit the package.json from openshift!!! its in c9 otg1 main folder not in the nodecellar folder.
maybe modify it like the package.json in nodecellar folder

best to clean up c9 and deploy again to openshift.
in c9 otg1 workspace:
delete node_modules under otg1 (it does not have all node dependencies)
keep all files in nodecellar folder...check that server_express40_bk2 runs ok.  test run ok.

delete all Openshift template files,  server.js, package.json, index.html, README. deplist

move all folders, files, eetc from nodecellar subfolder up to otg1(root) folder)
delete empty nodecellar folder
test everything works.  yes.. test successful

push to github and see what happens.
git remote -v to check all remote addresses

push to github recreated repo with new clean structure!

****go to openshift and clean up?? then deploy to it.
****no need to clean up just push to it.
next push to openshift....
did not complete 100%....better directory structure tho.

decided to start clean.
deleted the openshift app and created new with same name iotg1pglbluefish
new ssh key
git remote rm openshift  (deleted it)
git remote add openshift with the new ssh key information from openshift.

rhc ssh works and goes to the new repo.

git push to openshift.

set package.json "main" to point to server_express50_bk2.js.
didn't work then read this...
https://coderwall.com/p/wmyqbw
Most Google searches will bring back that the main parameter in your package.json would need to be changed to the correct file name, although after testing several times, I could not get it to work. Basically, I would deploy the application and after waiting about 5 minutes, my site would be still sitting at a 503 "Application Unavailable" error screen. Checking through SSH, node isn't even running!

There is a hidden gem within OpenShift that helps remedy this issue on deploy. In your pacakge.json file, you can add a snippet to set the command to be ran on deploy. Once I added this, deployed the application, I had a working website!

"scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js --websocket-port=$OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT --log-level=1"
}

also read this about environment variables 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20974094/openshift-node-js-error-listen-eacces
var ipaddress = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || "127.0.0.1";
var port = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
server.listen( port, ipaddress, function() {
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Server is listening on port 8080');
});


still error
remote: npm ERR! command "node" "/opt/rh/nodejs010/root/usr/bin/npm" "install" "-d"

well this got the app started in openshift finally.. at least the main index page is accessible.
but not the routes (except from address bar)
of course, links still point to c9 server!!! so need to edit/replace references to c9 url with openshift url
and should be done!!!
